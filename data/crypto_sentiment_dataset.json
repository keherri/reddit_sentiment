IMO large corporations having access to ~$0 energy while selling it for a cost isn't sustainable for true decentralization but whatever, it keeps coal mines from being profitable too if the hashrate can be inexpensively high.\nThe argument against it usually is that it allows existing mines to stay open longer by recycling their otherwise wasted energy into BTC which means they may not go bankrupt. That's still a step in the right direction compared to flaring it all into the sky though, and that BTC can be sent somewhere that has no power to create power (like oil is used).\n\nEvery 4 years the amount of new BTC minted per block is reduced by half, and the hashrate (security/difficulty to mine) is dependant on how many miners are trying to get the one block reward. That means if your costs 20K to mine a BTC that's worth 30K today, the next halving your costs will be 20K to receive 15K of BTC, and you would be forced to stop mining or find a cheaper alternative. If the price of BTC doubles than you are safe but (despite what btc maxis think) it can't double forever. It's a non-issue because it will solve itself. Ideally the costs from people buying blockspace (crypto fees) will be drastic enough to make up for today's prehalving inflation rate, which means a ton of POW being done to earn fees - but if today miners are already making the pivot to clean energy (and not by choice) I can't imagine in ~20 years it being any easier to use coal or otherwise.\n\nThe energy argument is a global one, picking just crypto is disingenuous because most people are completely ignorant about crypto so this is what they're taught. BTC is a legitimate currency in multiple Countries, crypto is used all over the world in places that don't have banks or face real inflation (Argentina), I spend it on cards in shops with and online too, VISA is using it because it's cheaper/faster than their existing rails, so is Stripe for the same reason. Volitility means you buy at the price you deserve not the price told to you, if housing bounced up and down every 4y and you weren't forced into a $1M two bedroom home maybe you'd be okay with it?\n\nThere are real problems with crypto but none of the things you mentioned.\n","Sentiment":"Positive","Reddit URL":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/us70jy/for_a_a_whole_year_now_cryptobitcoin_lost_people/"},{"worker_id":"YKPDD2RHZKMG","is_reviewed":false,"review_score":null,"Comment Text":"I thought it was a store of value....where'd the value go?\n\nBTC does nothing now.","Sentiment":"Negative","Reddit URL":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/um4inc/bitcoin_tumbles_more_than_50_below_its_alltime/"},{"worker_id":"6XFJ6ADHNKEZ","is_reviewed":false,"review_score":null,"Comment Text":"I bought at 64k and 37k.

Fast, secure, reliable. I have read a lot of articles, read whitepaper and bought Algo. But now after half a year of holding I have to say that it's really bad. And I'll tell you why. Keep in mind that I'm talking about the WHOLE ALGO ECOSYSTEM and not blockchain itself.\n\nDapps - like currently there are 5 or 6 daapps? This is a joke. Younger chains have hundreds of them but in algo ecosystem there are 5 or 6 dapps and they are working really bad (more about this in the next points. The chain being young is not an excuse because other chains have much more cool and usefull daaps. Algo dapps are using AVM (Algorand wirtual machine) so the adoption will be always slower and slower.\n\nDapps working like shit. Many of those daaps rely on a single source of truth that is Algoexplorer API. It has constant problems and because of that platforms like yieldly works like shit. November and December was horrible. There wasn't a single day without any issues.\n\nOfficial wallet... Sometimes is not working. Or not working correctly. It's too dependant on Algoexporer api and AWS.\n\nALGO is CENTRALIZED\n\nNo rewards for running own node\n\nYesterday the only Algorand DEX tinyman was compromised and hacked and all liquidity pools are gone.\n\nHorrible marketing.\n\nNo clear roadmap for 2022.\n\nUnfulfilled promises (example? about increasing TPS)\n\nA lot small ones like poor website (doesn't look professional) and poor communication with Algorand Foundation\n\nThe Algorand community on reddit is so toxic and blind. If the Algo price is increasing they are posting charts and yelling how awesome Algo is and the pump is incoming. When it's down they claim that it's just because of bitcoin? You get it? Algo UP - it's because algo is awesome? Algo down - because of bitcoin. They hate every other chain because only ALGORAND is the best.\n\nPoor price action comparing to other scalable solutions.\n\nOk some of you may disagree with some points but most of them are straigth facts.

It's up about 1000X. Bitcoin's price continues to grow at a very rapid rate, long term average. You see, there were good reasons for Bitcoin's rapid rise. Most of those reasons still exist. In fact, today there are even more good reasons than there were 10 or 5 years ago. It is reasonable to expect the long term average growth rate of Bitcoin to stay very high for the foreseeable future.\n\nReal estate has significant holding costs (eg: taxes, maintenance, insurance, sometimes fees, interest). Real estate isn't very liquid, and it has extremely high transaction costs.\n\nUltimately, the price of real estate (and rents) is limited by incomes. For example, in the long run people can't pay more for mort./rent than they earn. Realistically, they might be able to afford 35 or 40 percent of their net income for \"a place to live\". Thus, real estate prices are limited by incomes, in the long run. Incomes tend to barely keep up with inflation.\n\nLooking at long term historical data, such as Case-Shiller, for popular real estate markets, we see, in fact, that real estate prices barely track the rate of inflation, especially when the significant holding costs are properly accounted for.\n\nBitcoin has no such limit. Bitcoin has no holding costs. Bitcoin is liquid. Bitcoin transactions are typically very little. Bitcoin's price has been more than doubling every year, long term average, and as mentioned before, can reasonably be expected to continues its rapid ascent.\n\nReal estate is currently in a bubble, as evidenced by the price-to-income ratios. The current bubble will pop, as the prior bubble eventually had to pop.\n\nReal estate is nailed down. Bitcoin can be taken with you to anywhere in the world. Real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes. Real estate can be confiscated.\n\nWhen the private keys are properly stored, Bitcoin cannot be confiscated.\n\nKnowing all this, a person would be a total idiot to purchase real estate instead of investing in Bitcoin.\n\nHaving said that, I do plan on eventually using a small fraction (about 10 or 15 percent) of my Bitcoin holdings to buy my dream home - and to pay for it with Bitcoin, but still end up sitting on a serious stack of sats.\n\nI have zero regrets for investing in Bitcoin instead of real estate, and I never will.","Sentiment":"Positive","Reddit URL":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/uu4clg/bitcoin_instead_of_real_estate/"},{"worker_id":"X2TCAY3NA3EK","is_reviewed":false,"review_score":null,"Comment Text":"BTC has no legitimate competition.

Ethereum chose the most logical solutions for scalability: a lightweight layer 1 PoS system with sharding and excellent layer 2 options for high transaction throughput.

Still, that's a shitload. No wonder some of my non crypto friends think crypto is simply a penny stock market. Those of us in the space know some project have very good intentions and fail. Some succeed. Some just hang out. But so many others are pure scam and we all know it. I guess that is the price of decentralization and I sometimes struggle with this. We don't believe in censorship so why would we be in the business of telling new projects they aren't allowed because we are already too many in the room.\n\nSadly too many people will invest their life in dumb things like squid game tokens only to find no liquidity when trying to cash out. Others will simply be rug pulled. The worse part is the hit we as investors and believers of fundamentals take as it creates a bad reputation and gives crypto a terrible image. If politicians and regulators should have a beef with anything about crypto its these shady scam projects but how to determine a shady scam project until it is officially a scam. Many people in the crypto world still say Shib for example is a scam and that's their opinion. Many people not in crypto say Bitcoin is a scam. Many bitcoiners say ethereum is a scam and so on. So where do we go from here? One critique politicians often use is crypto can't police itself when it comes to these scams and rug pulls so they need harsh and strict regulation to be enforced and penalized. How can crypto police itself when project tribes can't stand each other and all they do is throw each other trash on twitter.\n\nMy hope is that in time as more and more people come in there are better educational tools for noobs to be aware of what is a fire hazard but I am not optimistic.

Whatever blockchain you identify as \"best tech\" can just be literally copied or forked, and the new chain with 0 track record is equally technically good.\n\nHaving said that, best for what? There are different blockchains that have some feature that distinguishes them from the rest, and if that feature is the standard, they'd be the best. Should everybody abandon whatever the top blockchain is every time a new project comes out that is \"better\"?\n\nETH is good. It was the first to do what it does, has a large number of qualified developers, and lots of nodes. As you say, cheaper, faster, etc. blockchains are now out there--but what's that to all the dApps built on ETH? There's a lot of inertia and human effort tied up in ETH smart contracts. And what if another new generation comes out next year even faster, smarter, cheaper, etc? Or should we go with L2s? Or chains cross-compatible with other chains? Or focus on bridges?\n\nIn the end, ETHs value has a lot to do with being first. It has a track record. Millions have found it reliable. Hackers have had at it. Legal jurisdictions have tolerated it. Any clone has a lesser track record. People are more inclined to trust such a blockchain than something shiny and new where they'd have to research the premine and inflation and developers and see if there are any new vulnerabilities that snuck into the code.\n\nBitcoin for money and Ethereum for computing do pretty good against the basic requirements for money or computing.

Pretty much all applications and a shitload of developers in crypto are on Ethereum, and pretty much all applications on other chains are forks of what has been developed on Ethereum, which says a lot. Just look at the top 100 cryptocurrencies, how many of them are tokens on Ethereum? A majority?\n\nDecentralization and safety. Ethereum could have lower fees by sacrificing decentralization like many other chains do, but they don't skimp on these values and in doing so they put safety first. And even if Ethereum did sacrifice decentralization it only goes so far and it is something all chains will face once users increase.\n\nSolution to the scalability trilemma. Ethereums solution is rollups and sharding, rollups are being implemented right now and has/will drastically decrease fees, sharding will plummet them even further whenever it arrives. The future is that people don't use layer 1 on Ethereum but use the rollups on Layer 2, you can preview this by buying ETH on Crypto.com, withdrawing onto Arbitrum (still quite high fees while in beta), and use on Curve Finance, just like you would with Ethereum Layer 1 or Avalanche.","Sentiment":"Positive","Reddit URL":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r561oe/comment/hml27bi/?utm_source=share\u0026utm_medium=web2x\u0026context=3"},{"worker_id":"TWT79CJH69RG","is_reviewed":false,"review_score":null,"Comment Text":"I’m actually excited because I had cash on the side for moments like this.","Sentiment":"Positive","Reddit URL":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/unnvmw/its_a_bloodbath_the_crypto_crash_is_real/"}]
